## Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

HAL layer will provide the interface between the Application Layer and Chipset.

A hardware abstraction layer (HAL) is a logical division of code that serves as an abstraction layer between
a computer's physical hardware and its software.

### GPIO

- GPIO interface is designed to interact with various platform signals in order to control the power/reset lines
of various components (like CPU, PCH, BMC) to achieve the quiesced pre-boot stage.
- The GPIO interface controls other reset lines to components which misconfigured could prevent platform boot.
- The Common Core GPIO interface will interact between HROT and Chipset.

### SPI Control

- SPI Controller is designed to provide the CPLD RoT design with direct access to the various platform flash storage.
Access to flash storage is used for authentication and recovery for all platform firmware.

### Smbus

- Smbus is two-wire interface often used for system management communication between Application and Chipset.

### Crypto

- Cryptographic Authentication of FW - Platform FW components perform cryptographic authentication to verify the signature
of the firmware at time of launch/consumption regardless of the verification performed by Platform Root-of-Trust.

### Timer

- Timer is a basic hardware block which provides an monotonically incrementing time value which is required by
the CPLD RoT design flows to monitor the boot progress of the platform.

### Interrupt

- Interrupt Handling on GPIO/SMBus/Timer

### UDS/CDI for DICE

- The Trusted Computing Group (TCG) specifies Hardware Requirements for a Device Identifier Composition Engine (DICE).
- Unique Device Secret (UDS) and a Compound Device Identifier (CDI) are used as defined in the TCG DICE specification.

### Spi Filter

- SPI Filter provides runtime security against malicious or erroneous traffic driven from a different platform component.
- The main purpose of the SPI Filter is to monitor all traffic driven to platform SPI flash and intercept any transactions
not allowed by the set of rules programmed by the CPLD RoT firmware.

### Smbus Filter

- SPI Filter provides runtime security against malicious or erroneous traffic driven from a different platform component.
- The main purpose of the SPI Filter is to monitor all traffic driven to platform SPI flash and intercept any transactions not allowed by the set of
rules programmed by the CPLD RoT firmware.

## Quantum Platform in C (QPC)

â€‹		The QPC provides a modern, reusable architecture of embedded applications, which combines object-orientation with the particular model of concurrency, known as active objects.

Qpc opensource will be used as library
